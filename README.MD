Make sure to remember the following text:
In the first question (, I have written a code that explains the grades of individual students. This function prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and outputs the corresponding grade.

In the second question , this function prompts the user to input the speed of a vehicle. It outputs "ok" if the speed is less than 70. If the speed is above 70, for every 5 km above 70, it should give the user one demerit point and print the total number of demerits.
